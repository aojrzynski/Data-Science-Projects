# Uncovering Global Socio-Economic Outliers

## Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying countries with unique or anomalous socio-economic conditions using various unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms. Through the use of K-Means clustering, DBSCAN, Isolation Forest, and One-Class SVM, the project seeks to uncover global outliers that may indicate countries facing extreme challenges or irregular patterns. The goal is to provide insights that can help target international aid and policy interventions for countries exhibiting significant socio-economic disparities.

# Increasing Employee Retention

## Project Overview
In this analysis, we aim to apply unsupervised learning techniques (K-Means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis) to segment employees within a medium-sized software company. By analyzing the company's employee data—covering demographics, performance, tenure, and attrition—we will identify distinct employee segments. The goal is to explore these segments and recommend strategies to enhance employee retention.

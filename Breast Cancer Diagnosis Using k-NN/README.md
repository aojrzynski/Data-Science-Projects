# Breast Cancer Diagnosis Using k-NN

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant using the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm. The model is built and evaluated on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, leveraging a series of preprocessing techniques, including feature scaling, dimensionality reduction through PCA, and addressing class imbalance with SMOTE. The goal is to create a reliable diagnostic tool that can assist in early detection and treatment of breast cancer.

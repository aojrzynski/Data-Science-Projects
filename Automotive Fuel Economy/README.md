# Automotive Fuel Economy

## Project Overview
In this analysis, the aim is to build a linear regression model to predict the fuel efficiency (measured in miles per gallon, mpg) of different vehicles based on various features such as the number of cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, and origin.

## Folder Structure

- **Data/**
  - `auto-mpg.csv`: Main data source. Contains information about various automobiles from the 1970s and 1980s. This dataset is available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
- **Notebooks/**
  - `Predicting Fuel Economy for Cars.ipynb`: Main notebook file with the analysis.
  
## How to Run the Analysis
Load the `Predicting Fuel Economy for Cars.ipynb` notebook file using Jupyter notebook (or similar software).

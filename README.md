# Data Science Projects
Welcome to the Data Science Projects repository. This repository contains various data data science projects implemented using various technologies and models.

## Project Overview
### Automotive Fuel Economy
- **Description:** In this analysis, aim is to build a linear regression model to predict the fuel efficiency (measured in miles per gallon, mpg) of different vehicles based on various features such as the number of cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, and origin.
- **Learning Type:** Supervised Learning
- **Technologies Used:** python, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, statsmodels, scipi
- **Algorithms/Models Used:** Linear Regression, Ridge Regression

### Increasing Employee Retention
- **Description:** This project aims to perform clustering on employee data to identify distinct groups within the workforce. The analysis includes exploring the relationships between these clusters and employee attrition rates, providing insights into factors contributing to employee turnover. Key features analyzed include gender, job satisfaction, commute distance, performance, and department affiliation. The project also employs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and visualization of the clusters.
- **Learning Type:** Unsupervised Learning
- **Technologies Used:** python, pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn
- **Algorithms/Models Used:** KMeans Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### Predicting Car Purchase Decisions
- **Description:** This project explores the factors influencing car purchase decisions. By leveraging data science techniques, particularly decision tree models, the project aims to predict whether a client will purchase a car based on demographic and financial information such as age, gender, and annual salary.
- **Learning Type:** Supervised Learning
- **Technologies Used:** python, pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn
- **Algorithms/Models Used:** Decision Tree, GridSearchCV

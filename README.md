# Data Science Projects
Welcome to the Data Science Projects repository. This repository contains various data data science projects implemented using various technologies and models.

## Project Overview
### Automotive Fuel Economy
- **Description:** In this analysis, aim is to build a linear regression model to predict the fuel efficiency (measured in miles per gallon, mpg) of different vehicles based on various features such as the number of cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, and origin.
- **Learning Type:** Supervised Learning
- **Technologies Used:** python, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, statsmodels, scipi
- **Algorithms/Models Used:** Linear Regression, Ridge Regression

### Breast Cancer Diagnosis Using k-NN
- **Description:** This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant using the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm, leveraging a series of preprocessing techniques, including feature scaling, dimensionality reduction through PCA, and addressing class imbalance with SMOTE.
- **Learning Type:** Supervised Learning
- **Technologies Used:** python, pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn
- **Algorithms/Models Used:** k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Classification, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)

### Increasing Employee Retention
- **Description:** This project aims to perform clustering on employee data to identify distinct groups within the workforce. The analysis includes exploring the relationships between these clusters and employee attrition rates, providing insights into factors contributing to employee turnover. Key features analyzed include gender, job satisfaction, commute distance, performance, and department affiliation. The project also employs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and visualization of the clusters.
- **Learning Type:** Unsupervised Learning
- **Technologies Used:** python, pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn
- **Algorithms/Models Used:** K-Means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### Predicting Car Purchase Decisions
- **Description:** This project explores the factors influencing car purchase decisions. By leveraging data science techniques, particularly decision tree models, the project aims to predict whether a client will purchase a car based on demographic and financial information such as age, gender, and annual salary.
- **Learning Type:** Supervised Learning
- **Technologies Used:** python, pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn
- **Algorithms/Models Used:** Decision Tree, GridSearchCV

### Uncovering Global Socio-Economic Outliers
- **Description:** This project focuses on identifying countries with unique or anomalous socio-economic conditions using various unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms. Through the use of K-Means clustering, DBSCAN, Isolation Forest, and One-Class SVM, the project seeks to uncover global outliers that may indicate countries facing extreme challenges or irregular patterns.
- **Learning Type:** Unsupervised Learning
- **Technologies Used:** python, pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn
- **Algorithms/Models Used:** K-Means, DBSCAN, Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM
